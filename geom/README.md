# Geometry package

`pdsp.py` provides definitions and utilities related to the ProtoDUNE geometry.  

The convention is shown in *pdsp.png*, where the 6 main TPCs are labeled with their numbers. Each TPC has a local coordinate illustrated in yellow, and the y coordinate (not shown) points upward with origin at the bottom.

The top of the file also contains constants in units of millimeter or microsecond. In particular, `VOXEL_SIZE` is the size of the unit voxel in the x, y, z dimensions. 

The Anode Plane Assembly geometry files can be generated by running `python pdsp.py` once. They are **needed** to perform tiling but too large to share on github. Note: `numba 0.50.1` (or possibly another version) should be installed even though it is not used here per se.
